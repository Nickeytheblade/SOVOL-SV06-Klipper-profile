# SOVOL SV06 Klipper firmware & profile
Complete Klipper profile with all config files and macros to tune the Sovol SV06 (stock)

You'll need a raspberry pi with it's own SD card, micro-usb cable to connect to the printer mainboard and another SD card to flash the printer

1- First you have to instal Mainsail Klipper, link to download : https://docs.mainsail.xyz/setup/mainsail-os


2- Once installed in your raspberry, follow the steps to make the config : https://www.klipper3d.org/Installation.html

  -> during "make menuconfig" select the STM32F103 with a "28KiB bootloader", serial (on USART1 PA10/PA9) communication and Disable "SWD at startup"
  
  -> run "make" and wait...


3- put the firmware.bin included here in your SD card to flash the printer (or the one generated by the previons config steps, you can find it in /home/pi/klipper/out/klipper.bin)

  -> The SD card should be formated in FAT32 with 4096 blocks to make your flash successfull
  
  
4- Turn off your printer, insert the flash SD card, turn on the printer and wait 1mn before turning it off and removing the SD card


5- Connect your printer by USB to the raspberry and go to your raspberry IP adress


6- Download .zip bundle file attached and Upload the configuration files in your raspberry :

  -> PRINTER.CFG in /home/pi/klipper_config/ directory, to have /home/pi/klipper_config/printer.cfg
  
  -> CONFIG folder WITH ALL THE INCLUDED FILES in the same directory, to have /home/pi/klipper_config/config/ with all the files in it
  
  
7- You should be able to connect klipper to the printer, if not you probably have a flash problem. Check if the SD card is correctly formated and change the name of your .bin (cause the printer don't flash if she receive the same name file twice)
  
  
8- Things to do before printing

  -> Run PID TUNE for heater and bed https://www.klipper3d.org/G-Codes.html?h=pid#pid_calibrate_1
  
  -> Run these included macros : 
  
        - GANTRY CALIBRATION to align the gantry with the top frame,
        
        - BED MESH to make a 25 points bed mesh,
        
        - Z OFFSET to calibrate your Z offset.
        
  -> Be sure you have in mainsail.cfg :
  
                                            [virtual_sdcard]
                                            path: /home/pi/printer_data/gcodes
                                            
  -> See available options under /config/options.cfg
  
 Happy printing ;)
